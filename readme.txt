Set expiry dates for user logins.

== Description ==

> Important security update - if you are using version 0.2 or earlier please upgrade

**Currently a beta version.**

This plugin allows you to set expiry dates for user logins. You can set a user to:

* Never expire (default)
* Expire in X days, weeks, moths or years
* Expire on a specific date

When a user expires you can:

* Change the role of that user
* Replace the user's password with a randomly generated one
* Send an email notification to the user
* Send an email notification to the site administrator
* Perform you own actions using an [`expire_users_expired`](https://github.com/benhuson/expire-users/wiki/expire_users_expired) hook

You can automatically assign expiry details to users who sign up via the register form.

The email notification messages can be configured in the admin settings.
